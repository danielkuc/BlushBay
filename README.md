# E-commerce store front project.
  Created mainly as a react learning project, I wanted to build a store front using external data (fake makeup API),
## What I've learned and technologies used:
  * Modals
  * Axios
  * Http requests to backend and external API
  * State and props management
  * React Context
  * Bootstrap and styled-components for styling, and responsiveness.
  * bootstrap-react to make bootstrap work with react, used it's hamburger menu and few other components.
  
## How to use : 
  - Navigate the website at your leisure, but bare in mind it is a dummy store front.
  - Go to products to populate list of items from external API
  - Cart is fully functional with the exception of payments
  - Click on a product to see it's details
